## Overview

This example demonstrates how to use Sponge to generate a gRPC service and integrate it with DTM (Distributed Transaction Management) and service registration and discovery (e.g., etcd, Consul, Nacos).

<br>

### Building the Transfer Service

The transfer service (gRPC) code is automatically generated by [Sponge](https://github.com/zhufuyi/sponge) (select `â“¸Create grpc service based on protobuf`). After generation, fill in the transfer-related business logic in the template code file (e.g., `internal/service/transfer.go`).

The image below shows the code generation interface:

![sponge-dtm-service-registration-discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhufuyi/sponge_examples/main/assets/en_sponge-dtm-service-registration-discovery.png)

UnZip file, navigate to the project root directory (e.g., the transfer directory) and run the following commands to generate the code:

```bash
# Generate code
make proto

# Open the internal/service/transfer.go file and add business logic according to the generated sample code.

# Compile and start the service
make run
```

For more detailed documentation on creating gRPC services with Sponge, refer to: [Sponge gRPC Development Documentation](https://go-sponge.com/zh-cn/microservice-development-protobuf).

**Key Implementation Code:**

- Import the `dtmdriver-sponge` driver at line 9 in [internal/rpcclient/dtmservice.go](internal/rpcclient/dtmservice.go).
- Submit the two-phase message transaction at line 65 in [internal/service/transfer.go](internal/service/transfer.go).

### Using etcd for Service Discovery

Download the [DTM](https://github.com/dtm-labs/dtm/releases/tag/v1.19.0) executable, modify the default DTM configuration.

Follow these steps to use etcd for service registration and discovery:

1. **Start etcd Service**
    - Ensure that the etcd service is running locally or in the target environment.

2. **Configure DTM Service**
    - Modify the DTM configuration file `conf.yml` to register the service with etcd:
      ```yaml
      MicroService:
        Driver: 'dtm-driver-sponge'
        Target: 'etcd://127.0.0.1:2379/dtmservice'
        EndPoint: 'grpc://127.0.0.1:36790'
      ```

3. **Start DTM Service**
    - Start DTM using the following command:
      ```bash
      dtm -c conf.yml
      ```

4. **Configure Transfer Service**
    - Update the `configs/transfer.yml` configuration file and set `registryDiscoveryType` to etcd to enable service registration and discovery:
      ```yaml
      app:
        registryDiscoveryType: "etcd"  # Service registration and discovery types: consul, etcd, nacos. If empty, registration and discovery are not used.
 
      grpcClient:
        - name: "dtmservice"          # DTM service name for service discovery
          registryDiscoveryType: "etcd"  # Service registration and discovery types: consul, etcd, nacos. If empty, direct connection using host and port
          host: "127.0.0.1"             # DTM service address; ignored if service discovery is enabled
          port: 36790                    # DTM service port; ignored if service discovery is enabled
 
      etcd:
        addrs: ["127.0.0.1:2379"]
      ```

5. **Start Transfer Service**
    - Compile and run the transfer service:
      ```bash
      cd cmd/transfer
      go run main.go
      
      # or
      make run
      ```

6. **Test the Service**
    - Open the generated gRPC client test code `internal/service/transfer_client_test.go` and fill in the test parameters, for example:
      ```go
      {
          name: "Transfer",
          fn: func() (interface{}, error) {
              // Fill in the test parameters
              req := &transferV1.TransferRequest{
                  Amount:     100,
                  FromUserId: 1,
                  ToUserId:   2,
              }
              return cli.Transfer(ctx, req)
          },
          wantErr: false,
      }
      ```
    - In a new terminal, navigate to the `internal/service` directory and run the following command to test:
      ```bash
      go test -run Test_service_transfer_methods/Transfer
      ```
    - **Tip**: If using `Goland IDE`, open the code `internal/service/transfer_client_test.go`, and click the green button on the left to run the test directly.

### Using Consul for Service Registration and Discovery

1. Ensure that the Consul service is running locally or in the target environment.

2. Open the `configs/transfer.yml` configuration file for the transfer service and change `registryDiscoveryType` under both `app` and `grpcClient` sections to `consul`. Then, fill in the address under the `consul` section.

3. Modify the DTM service configuration file `conf.yml`, updating the `Target` field under `MicroService` to the Consul address (e.g., `consul://127.0.0.1:8500/dtmservice`).

4. Restart both the DTM and transfer services, and test whether the API calls function correctly.

### Using Nacos for Service Registration and Discovery

1. Ensure that the Nacos service is running locally or in the target environment.

2. Open the `configs/transfer.yml` configuration file for the transfer service, change `registryDiscoveryType` under both `app` and `grpcClient` sections to `nacos`, and fill in the address and `namespaceID` under the `nacos` section.

3. Modify the DTM service configuration file `conf.yml`, updating the `Target` field under `MicroService` to the Nacos address (e.g., `nacos://127.0.0.1:8848/dtmservice?namespaceID=xxx`).

4. Restart both the DTM and transfer services, and test whether the API calls function correctly.

**Note**: The `namespaceID` in both the DTM and transfer configuration files must match. The default `namespaceID` is `public`. If a different value is specified, ensure it is consistently updated in all relevant configurations.
